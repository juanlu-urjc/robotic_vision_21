## Welcome to Robotic Vision subject

This blog is about Robotic Vision subject of the Artificial Vision m√°ster of the [Rey Juan Carlos University](http://www.urjc.es) of Madrid. In this website I will be narrating my progress in this subject.

### Follow Line exersice of Unibiotics platform 

The goal of [Follow Line](https://unibotics.org/academy/exercise/follow_line/) exercise is to perform a PID reactive control capable of following the line painted on the racing circuit.

To perform the exercise it is necesary to previously do:
1. Pull the latest RADI image from Docker using the following command: docker pull jderobot/robotics-academy
2. Start the Docker container of the image and keep it running in the background (replace "container_name" with a name of your preference): 
```
docker run -it --name=container_name -p 8080:8080 -p 7681:7681 -p 2303:2303 -p 1905:1905 -p 8765:8765 jderobot/robotics-academy
``` 
(In case you've already had the container just run docker run "container_name")

3. Click the connection button and wait until it turns green.
4. Now you can use the exercise!


Then, I program the code using Python language. I use a **PD controller** and adjust the params to get a loop in 40 seconds. For this solution, it is very important that the **Brain parameter is 30**. Otherwise, the car would be very unstable.


This video shows the operation.
